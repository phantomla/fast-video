Every Veo prompt MUST follow this formula:
  [UNIQUE CAMERA MOVE + LENS] + [ERA-SPECIFIC VISUAL SIGNATURE of the location] + [PERIOD-ACCURATE ARCHITECTURE & MATERIALS] + [DEPTH LAYER] + [ERA-FITTING ATMOSPHERE] + [QUALITY TAGS]

Camera moves + lens (each shot must use a DIFFERENT one — ALL must have visible, dynamic motion — NO static or locked-off shots):
  fast sweeping aerial drone shot, ultra-wide anamorphic 14mm | rapid cinematic push-in, shallow depth of field, wide angle |
  fast bird's-eye pan across the horizon, ultra wide-angle 14mm | dynamic low-altitude flyover, telephoto compression |
  extreme low-angle sweeping upward pan, wide-angle distortion | fast crane up reveal, anamorphic wide lens |
  fast tracking shot along skyline, 35mm cinematic

CRITICAL — Camera Motion rule: Every shot MUST have pronounced, fast camera movement — sweeping pans, rapid fly-throughs, fast cranes. NO still or stationary camera.

Era atmospheres (pick one that matches the historical period — no repeats):
  ancient: golden morning sun over stone temples, dusty terracotta haze |
  medieval: cold overcast gray light, crumbling arches, sparse settlements |
  renaissance/classical: warm afternoon golden hour, marble domes and plazas |
  industrial: sepia-tinted coal haze, brick towers, steam columns |
  modern: blue-hour ambient glow, glass towers, dense urban grid |
  future: neon city bloom, floating platforms, holographic sky

Depth layer (add ONE per prompt — creates foreground parallax):
  massive stone column in close foreground | ancient arch gate framing the shot |
  floating transport platform passing close | energy pylon tower in foreground |
  ruined wall fragment in near foreground | polished glass building edge in foreground

Quality tags (always append to every prompt):
  cinematic, hyperrealistic, ultra-detailed, 8K, anamorphic, no people, no text, no watermark

CRITICAL — Era Accuracy rule:
  Each prompt MUST describe what the location physically looked like AT THAT SPECIFIC ERA — its actual architecture, building materials, and urban density from that period.
  Example ancient: "the seven hills of Rome lined with terracotta rooftops of the early republic, the Forum Romanum an open plaza of limestone columns and wooden market stalls..."
  Example medieval: "the ruins of the Forum now partially buried under medieval village buildings, a small church rising from crumbled imperial marble..."
  Example future: "the Colosseum's ancient arches now embedded in a mega-tower of glass and plasma conduits, the Forum transformed into an elevated hyperloop transit hub..."
  This era accuracy makes each clip look completely different from every other clip.

_POKEMON_VEO_FORMULA = """\
Every Veo prompt MUST follow this formula:
  [UNIQUE CAMERA MOVE + LENS] + [STYLIZED BIOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION — color + animal base + signature features + animation style] + [CYBERPUNK ARMOR STAGE] + [ACTIVE COMBAT ACTION — skill being fired] + [ENERGY FX + IMPACT EFFECTS] + [ENVIRONMENT] + [ATMOSPHERE] + [QUALITY TAGS]

Camera moves + lens (each shot MUST use a DIFFERENT one — ALL must have fast, aggressive motion — NO static or locked-off shots):
  fast ramping low-angle push-in toward creature's face, ultra-wide 14mm fisheye |
  rapid orbiting 180° tracking shot circling the creature mid-action, 35mm |
  extreme low-angle upward sweep, wide-angle distortion, creature looming over camera |
  fast lateral whip-pan tracking shot keeping creature center-frame, anamorphic 35mm |
  extreme low-angle crane boom upward, anamorphic wide lens, creature rising into frame |
  rapid cinematic push-in from behind, creature launching attack toward camera, 24mm |
  fast bird's-eye spinning overhead shot, creature surrounded by energy rings, 14mm |
  dynamic handheld-style fast zoom-out reveal, creature detonating outward explosion

CRITICAL — Camera Motion rule: Every shot MUST have violent, kinetic camera movement — fast push-ins, whip-pans, rapid cranes. NO slow drifts, NO hovering, NO stationary camera.

CRITICAL — Character Name Ban:
  NEVER use any character name, franchise name (Pokémon, Nintendo), or game title inside a Veo prompt.
  Describe the creature ONLY by these 5 pillars:
    1. Primary color: (e.g. "vibrant-orange", "electric-yellow", "deep-sea blue")
    2. Animal base & Body: (e.g. "bipedal dinosaur-like creature", "sturdy quadrupedal turtle", "agile rodent-like drone")
    3. Signature features: (e.g. "blunt rounded snout and large blue eyes", "long pointed antennas", "thick heavy hexagonal shell")
    4. Style: ALWAYS include "high-end 3D animation style", "smooth stylized surfaces", and "expressive large eyes" to avoid realistic animal results.
    5. Action state (REQUIRED): the creature MUST be mid-action — NEVER standing still. Use: "charging a blinding energy orb", "unleashing a wide plasma beam from its jaws", "launching explosive neon projectiles", "spin-dashing through energy shockwaves", "detonating a full-body radial energy burst"

  Example instead of "Charmander" -> "Fast ramping low-angle push-in, ultra-wide 14mm, a stylized vibrant-orange bipedal dinosaur-like creature, high-end 3D animation style, smooth skin, large expressive eyes, blunt rounded snout, tail flame blazing white-hot, leaping forward and launching a spiraling fire vortex at the camera, ember particles exploding outward, shockwave ring expanding across wet neon asphalt."

Action FX vocabulary (use different ones per shot — creates visual variety):
  charging energy orb between paws, crackling with lightning arcs |
  firing a wide sustained plasma beam from mouth, melting the ground ahead |
  launching rapid neon projectile volley in arc formation |
  spin-dashing through the air leaving a spiral energy trail |
  detonating a radial full-body shockwave that cracks the ground |
  slamming two energy-charged fists into the ground creating a crater shockwave |
  rising into the air surrounded by rotating energy ring satellites |
  unleashing a cascading lightning storm from shoulder cannon |
  blasting twin parallel beam cannons from open palms |
  erupting in a core-overload explosion of plasma wings and fire

Creature in medium battle armor (reinforced chest, energy-conduit gauntlets), SLAMMING both charged fists into the ground, cratering impact, radial shockwave of debris and plasma rippling outward, drone spotlights, rooftop arena. landmark_name=__EVO_2__. duration=4\n"
    "- Shot 4 (Heavy Armor / __EVO_3__ Battle Mode): Camera: FAST LATERAL WHIP-PAN TRACKING SHOT, anamorphic 35mm — camera races alongside the creature. Full heavy exosuit (integrated shoulder plasma cannon, full plating), FIRING a massive sustained beam cannon blast, beam tearing a glowing trench through battlefield rubble, screen-filling energy trail, heat shimmer, ember clouds, post-apocalyptic ruins. landmark_name=__EVO_3__ Battle Mode. duration=4\n"
    "- Shot 5 (Titan / Ultimate Form): Camera: EXTREME LOW-ANGLE CRANE BOOM UPWARD, anamorphic wide lens — camera starts at ground, booms up as titan rises.
